    <string name="about_description_detail">You can customise your avatar however you like: choose
        from a range of clothing, bags, accessories, and even personal characteristics such as eyes.
        Save up karma points to buy cool new accessories for your avatar, or perhaps a new item of
        clothing. \n\nTo gain these karma points, you and your avatar can go on adventures, making
        powerful decisions and learning about sex education. Changed your mind about something your
        avatar did? You always have the option of replaying a scene.

    <string name="about_project_description">We live in a time where sexual activity is becoming
        increasingly common amongst adolescents and even preadolescents. Sex education at school or
        information from parents/guardians and can be very awkward too, making it more challenging
        for you to know what to do when confronted with such a situation in real life. PowerUp is a
        game that will help you discover and learn through interaction with other characters, such
        as a friend from school.
